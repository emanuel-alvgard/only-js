# lite.js 
Data Oriented Web Framework.

**Disclaimer**
------
+ This project is currently being developed by a single person and will continue to be so until
it has passed it's most experimental stage.
+ The file "runtime.html" is representing a generated output. 
Hence the runtime is currently being programmed in a single html file. 

**Examples**
------
```javascript
import lt from 'lite.js'
```
**Features**
------
+ Lightweight runtime (10KB, minify + gzip)
+ Superb runtime performance
+ Pure JavaScript (no template syntax)
+ Zero dependencies
+ Virtually no additional garbage collection (except from requestAnimationFrame)
+ Virtual DOM with a flat hierarchy
+ Avoids JIT deoptimization

**Vision**
------
*To create a data oriented web framework 
with as little performance bottlenecks as possible, where 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS are unified into a coherent and readable interface.*
