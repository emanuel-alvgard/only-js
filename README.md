# lite.js 
Data Oriented Web Framework.

**Disclamer**
------
The file "runtime.html" is representing a generated output. 
Hence the runtime is currently developed in a single html file.

**Examples**
------
```javascript
import lt from 'lite.js'
```
**Features**
------
+ Lightweight runtime (10KB, minify + gzip)
+ Superb runtime performance
+ Pure JavaScript (no template syntax)
+ Zero dependencies
+ Virtually no additional garbage collection (except from requestAnimationFrame)
+ Virtual DOM with a flat hierarchy
+ Avoids JIT deoptimization

**Vision**
------
*To create a data oriented web framework 
with as little performance bottlenecks as possible, where 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS are unified into a coherent, readable and pure interface.*
